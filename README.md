# NutritionAssistant
## Backgroud and Target
I am entering my fourth year of fitness, and I still haven't found a user-friendly diet tracking tool to help me manage my diet progress. Therefore, I am trying to create a web application that integrates AI for intelligent diet logging and management. It will be able to provide personalized dietary recommendations and automatically record your eating habits. Additionally, it includes a calendar and tracking charts to make it convenient for fitness enthusiasts to monitor their progress.

## Features
**Main Features**
Based on the user's dietary needs, the AI assistant will provide:
1. Nutritional knowledge (e.g., nutritional requirements based on the user's training goals)
2. Restaurant meals (e.g., Subways, TGI Friday's)
3. Recipes (e.g., red wine-braised beef, poached chicken breast)
4. Personalized nutritional recommendation System
**Secondary Features**
Assist users in recording and tracking their diet by providing:
5. Automatic food import functionality by the AI assistant
6. Calendar
7. Tracking chart
