# NutritionAssistant
## backgroud
I am entering my fourth year of fitness, and I still haven't found a user-friendly diet tracking tool to help me manage my diet progress. Therefore, I am trying to create a web application that integrates AI for intelligent diet logging and management. It will be able to provide personalized dietary recommendations and automatically record your eating habits. Additionally, it includes a calendar and tracking charts to make it convenient for fitness enthusiasts to monitor their progress.

## Data Source
All nutrition information comes from the website https://www.usda.gov/. It is primarily divided into two datasets: foundation food and branded food.


* foundation food : Data and metadata on individual samples of commodity/commodity-derived minimally processed foods with insights into variability (Update Frequency -> April and October of each year)
* branded food : Data from labels of national and international branded foods collected by a public-private partnership (Update Frequency -> Monthly)


The nutrition information for this assistant API has been validated through comparison with the data on https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/.

## project target
### phase 1 (now here)
Build a reliable nutrition assistant through the OpenAI Assistant API.
### phase 2
Integrate the nutrition assistant into the project app.
### phase 3
Other secondary features of the project app include recording calendars, tracking charts, and recommending diets.
