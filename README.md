# NutritionAssistant
I am entering my fourth year of fitness, and I still haven't found a user-friendly diet tracking tool to help me manage my diet progress. Therefore, I am trying to create a web application that integrates AI for intelligent diet logging and management. It will be able to provide personalized dietary recommendations and automatically record your eating habits. Additionally, it includes a calendar and tracking charts to make it convenient for fitness enthusiasts to monitor their progress.
